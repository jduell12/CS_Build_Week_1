      <p>
        The Game Of Life (also known as Life) was created by John Conway in
        1970. The game is considered a zero-player game, which means that the
        evolution of the game is determined by the initial state of the game and
        doesn't need any further input. Since this game allows changes to the
        state of the game based on pre-defined rules it is considered a Turing
        machine (also Turing Complete)
